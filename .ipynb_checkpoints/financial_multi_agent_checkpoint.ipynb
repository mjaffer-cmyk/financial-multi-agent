I need to use the tools provided to get the most accurate and up-to-date information. The available tool is tavily_search, which is a search engine optimized for current events and can retrieve real-time data.\\n\\nFirst, I should structure the search query. The user wants the stock price, so the query should be something like \"current stock price of Apple\". That\\'s straightforward. Now, considering the parameters for tavily_search. Since stock prices are financial information, I should set the topic to \"finance\" to get more relevant results. \\n\\nAlso, stock prices change rapidly, so time sensitivity is important. The user is asking for the \"current\" price, which implies they want the latest data. The time_range parameter can be set to \"day\" to ensure the results are from today. However, I should check if the time_range is necessary here. The default for time_range is None, but since the user is asking for current prices, including a time_range of \"day\" might help in getting the most recent data. \\n\\nAnother thing to consider is domains. The user didn\\'t specify any particular website, but financial stock prices are often found on financial news sites or stock market platforms. However, since the user didn\\'t restrict domains, maybe it\\'s better not to include include_domains unless necessary. Excluding domains might not be needed here either. \\n\\nThe search_depth should be \"advanced\" because stock prices require precise and up-to-date information. Basic might not suffice. Also, include_images is probably not needed here since the user is asking for a stock price, which is numerical data. \\n\\nWait, but sometimes stock price information might be presented with charts or images, but the user just needs the current price. So maybe images aren\\'t necessary. \\n\\nSo putting it all together, the function call should be tavily_search with the query \"current stock price of Apple\", topic set to \"finance\", and time_range as \"day\". That should fetch the latest stock price from reliable financial sources. \\n\\nI should also check if there are any other parameters that might be useful. For example, start_date and end_date could be used to narrow down the date range, but since the user wants the current price, setting time_range to \"day\" should cover it. \\n\\nAnother consideration: sometimes stock prices are delayed by a few minutes, but the search engine should pick up the latest available data. \\n\\nTherefore, the tool call should include the query, topic as finance, and time_range as day. That should give the user the most accurate current stock price for Apple.', 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'ZUX7Saj0Y', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_search', 'arguments': '{\"time_range\": \"day\", \"topic\": \"finance\", \"query\": \"current stock price of Apple\"}'}}]} response_metadata={'role': 'assistant', 'reasoning_content': 'Okay, the user is asking for the current stock price of Apple.

The available tool is tavily_search, which is a search engine optimized for current events and can retrieve real-time data.\\n\\nFirst, I should structure the search query. The user wants the stock price, so the query should be something like \"current stock price of Apple\". That\\'s straightforward. Now, considering the parameters for tavily_search. Since stock prices are financial information, I should set the topic to \"finance\" to get more relevant results. \\n\\nAlso, stock prices change rapidly, so time sensitivity is important. The user is asking for the \"current\" price, which implies they want the latest data. The time_range parameter can be set to \"day\" to ensure the results are from today. However, I should check if the time_range is necessary here. The default for time_range is None, but since the user is asking for current prices, including a time_range of \"day\" might help in getting the most recent data. \\n\\nAnother thing to consider is domains. The user didn\\'t specify any particular website, but financial stock prices are often found on financial news sites or stock market platforms. However, since the user didn\\'t restrict domains, maybe it\\'s better not to include include_domains unless necessary. Excluding domains might not be needed here either. \\n\\nThe search_depth should be \"advanced\" because stock prices require precise and up-to-date information. Basic might not suffice. Also, include_images is probably not needed here since the user is asking for a stock price, which is numerical data. \\n\\nWait, but sometimes stock price information might be presented with charts or images, but the user just needs the current price. So maybe images aren\\'t necessary. \\n\\nSo putting it all together, the function call should be tavily_search with the query \"current stock price of Apple\", topic set to \"finance\", and time_range as \"day\". That should fetch the latest stock price from reliable financial sources. \\n\\nI should also check if there are any other parameters that might be useful. For example, start_date and end_date could be used to narrow down the date range, but since the user wants the current price, setting time_range to \"day\" should cover it. \\n\\nAnother consideration: sometimes stock prices are delayed by a few minutes, but the search engine should pick up the latest available data. \\n\\nTherefore, the tool call should include the query, topic as finance, and time_range as day. That should give the user the most accurate current stock price for Apple.', 'content': None, 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'ZUX7Saj0Y', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_search', 'arguments': '{\"time_range\": \"day\", \"topic\": \"finance\", \"query\": \"current stock price of Apple\"}'}}], 'token_usage': {'prompt_tokens': 1956, 'total_tokens': 2562, 'completion_tokens': 606, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'model_name': 'nvidia/nvidia-nemotron-nano-9b-v2'} id='run--ddb1a417-061b-40d8-8826-a01425ef63dc-0' tool_calls=[{'name': 'tavily_search', 'args': {'time_range': 'day', 'topic': 'finance', 'query': 'current stock price of Apple'}, 'id': 'ZUX7Saj0Y', 'type': 'tool_call'}] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1956, 'output_tokens': 606, 'total_tokens': 2562} role='assistant'\n",
